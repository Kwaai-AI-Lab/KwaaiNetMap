# SHA-256 front end. Stock macOS ships `shasum` (a perl script) but not
# `sha256sum`; most Linux images ship `sha256sum` and usually, but not always,
# `shasum`. Git Bash on a Windows runner reaches this script through
# `run: bash …` in release.yml, and that path runs only on a tag push — so a
# hashing problem there would surface during a release rather than in any PR
# check. Rather than establish which tool every host has, use whichever works.
#
# Probed by running them, not by `command -v`: `shasum` is a perl script, so it
# can exist on PATH and still fail (a Git Bash with a broken or absent perl is
# exactly that shape). Existence is not usability, and picking a present-but-
# broken tool would skip a working fallback — verified against a stub `shasum`
# that exits 2 with a perl error.
#
# Both accept the same `HASH  FILE` input in `-c` mode, so one shim covers the
# stamp calculation and the crate verification alike.
